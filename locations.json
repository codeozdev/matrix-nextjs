As the name suggests, power plants generate electrical energy for 01's inhabitants, the Machines. Each cylindrical tower contains up to hundreds of thousands of pods. Inside each pod is a human, connected through a series of grafts, plugs, and wires into the circuitry of the pod. Each human's mind exists in a shared dreamâ€”a neural-interactive virtual world known as the Matrix, fully convinced in almost all cases that they are alive, awake, and living on Earth around the turn of the 21st century.",
